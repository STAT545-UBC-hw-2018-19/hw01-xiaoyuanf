# STAT 545A Homework 01

Welcome to my repository!  

This is my first homework of [STAT 545A][1]. 

This repo contains a [README](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-xiaoyuanf/blob/master/README.md) file, and a [hw01_gapminder](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw01-xiaoyuanf/blob/master/hw01_gapminder.md) file which explores the database **gapminder** a bit.

## About me
